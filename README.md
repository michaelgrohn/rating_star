```shell
$ bundle
```

## Setup

### Migration
```shell
rails generate ratings
rake db:migrate
```

### Model
```ruby
# app/models/movie.rb
is_rateable
```

That's it! ðŸ˜ƒ

## Usage
```ruby
@movie = Movie.find_by name: 'The Dark Knight'
@movie.ratings << Rating.new( 0.9 )
```
```ruby
# app/views/movies/show.html.haml
...
= render @movie.rating
...
